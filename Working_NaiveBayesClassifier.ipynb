How sad that both you and FB couldn't figure this out in well over a year.\\n\", \"0,I hate it. It's the most annoying app I've ever dealt with but I have no choice if I want people to be able to privately message me. Popping up on my screen when I'm busy with something else? Stupid. If I read it it shows the other party that it's been read, so now I'm rude for not immediately getting back to them. There's enough of that with texting. This app is a giant pain.\\n\", \"1,I've never had any problems with this app on the kindle fire. It's fast and the notifications work just fine.

Perfect!.\\n\", \"0,Didn't like it at all. I use a tablet and they make it impossible to get rid of the little face once someone has sent you a message. So I had all these little heads all over my screen. It was ridiculous. Had to delete the app to get rid of them. Do not recommend for tablet users.\\n\", \"0,I don't know why but keeps cutting out on me, maybe they need to do some work on it, on my pc I use an app called easy chat and it works great, so that's what I use on pc, but I can't get it on my tablet because it is windows 10 app.\\n\", '1,Great App\\n', '1,The.

The story doesn't ignore or emphasize the other aspects of the war which we often hear about. I highly recommend this book even if one doesn't know a great deal about war planes. I very much enjoyed and appreciated this story!\\n\", '0,I run Facebook on a Kindle Fire with no issues including sending private messages. For some reason, FB Messenger does not run on the Kindle Fire operating system. App needs some further development.\\n', '1,Works great, it helps me keep in touch with my friends who do not have phones, and those overseas.

It sure came in handy recently when I had to be without a phone for 2 weeks. My son was changing cellphone providers. He lives 500 miles away from me & travels all over the Western US for his work. I mailed him my phone & it took 2 weeks before I received my new one. It was horrible being without a phone. But, thanks to Facebook Messenger, I wasn't completely disconnected to all my friends & family. It's user friendly & the auto correction is the smartest one I've used. And did I mention that it's free? Yes, it's really free. Try it. You have nothing to lose.\\n\", '1,This game is captivating, does not get boring and is great for improving memory and visual skills. My husband and I both enjoy without spending money. It has plenty of rewards that you can cash in for more game time. Love it!\\n', \"0,Just downloaded this finally after reading other reviews wasn't going to do it but went ahead . Working on my Kindle Fire Hd good so far . After downloading this facebook messenger and signing in then had to update it. Sent messages to friends the replied back on this app. Even got a message dot on front of my carousel letting me know I received a message back. Hope this continues to work right after all my friends and family are on this now . 3 stars so far cause I haven't had this app downloaded to long on my Kindle Fire Hd . But happy with it right now :) Thanks Amazon for this free app now I can FINALLY join my friends and family on here !!\\n\", \"1,I love face book messenger app on my phone. My phone dings when I get a Facebook message. You don't have to wait until you go online to Facebook to get the message. You can click on the icon and go straight to the message to read the message and reply right from your phone. It is just like using text messaging on your phone. I don't have everyone's cell number that is my friend on Facebook so this makes it easy to get in touch quickly with those friends without having to track down someone who has their number. If you know they are on Facebook often this is the way to get in touch. It works well with my I phone. I haven't found any reason not to continue to use it on my I phone 5S. It was easy to install on my phone and easy to use. It is a good tool for me I use it all the time.\\n\", \"1,The app does its job quite well. There's only one minor problem that has been bugging ever since I had installed this app. For some reason, the app keeps updating itself as much as twice every single day. I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that or if I'm the only one experiencing this. Either way, I'd like some answers. Overall though, solid app.\\n\", '1,Definitely better for fire hd 6 than iPhone 5... the ability to see the \"face bubbles\" makes it sooo much easier than opening and closing the app no matter what.. I can\\'t believe iPhones/iPads still make you exit the screen to respond.. I got this for my fire and I love it.. It\\'s like a breath of fees air haha!\\n', '1,I use this every single day! All day! Husband and kids and parents and everyone else contact me threw it when I am at home because I have no single yet great wifi! One of the 1st things I download when I reset my cell or get a new one. Its very user friendly and pretty much think-less. Tons or great and easy to use features. I have my daughter in law labeled as Evil Daughter In Law..lol She has me as Wicked Mother In law.. My daughter labeled herself as Loveliest Daughter in the world and me worlds best mommy! Careful though, the other person sees what you tag them as... lol So if you tag someone in your phone as \"Love of my Life\" or \"side Chick\" they will know it instantly. You can even change colors of your chats pages now and it has loads of cool emoticons.\\n', \"1,I like this app, most of the time. I like the fact I don't have to sign in to get my messages and I can see who has sent me the message. It does use alot of space on my phone but I guess that's par for the course.\\n\", \"1,I really like Facebook Messenger. I don't really like logging into FB all the time to see if I have messages from important people in my life or to keep up with messages from groups I belong to. With this app, I can let it run in the background as I am reading or doing other stuff online, and it will notify me when I have a message. The app is easy to use. There are a ton of those emojis you can use if you want to. I can even read the messages in my notifications on my tablet if I want, without having to open the actual app. I can reply with simple thumbs up from within notifications. The reason I knocked it one point is that you can not copy and paste text from messages and it takes up a lot of memory. Otherwise, I find it one of my most useful apps and would recommend it to other Android tablet users. I downloaded this from the Amazon App store, where it is free. ?\\n\", \"1,It's great. I would have recommend Facebook messenger for a safely reason or more than a safely reason, and no matter who's on Facebook that people can reach because some might not wanted anyone to know their 2 nd cell phone # for their own safely reason.\\n\", \"1,I don't know why people say this app doesn't work with Kindle because it is working fine for me. Their picture pops up and you click on it to get the message. The only annoying thing is the picture stays there when your done.\\n\", '0,This app is really helpful so I know when I get my messages on facebook but does glitch often, which means I have to exit out of the app and go back in to it to read the message. Also chat bubbles DO NOT work. To add in, I do have to turn my internet off then back on to send messages once in a while. Overall I would say the benefits outweigh the negatives. Enjoy! (:\\n', \"1,A lot of people people say it doesn't work for kindle IT DOES!!! This is what I use to text my friends from school and family that does not live in town well, I most definitely recommend this app it deserves more that 5 stars think about it, face time calling and texting and..... ITS FREEE!!!! It doesn't get much better than that definitely get this for facebook?????????????????????????\\n\", \"1,Great fun! I finally let myself download Facebook Messenger. And I'm very happy that I did. I had a lot of fun setting it up and putting my family and friends know that I had it. I'm sure that I will find lots of uses for it in the future.\\n\", \"1,A very useful tool to connect with friends.! The things you can do with it are cool! Like make group's and stuff\\n\", \"1,Messenger is the easiest and quickest way to contact anyone, whether by cel phone, computer or ipad. Messenger alerts you when a message is sent or received, and it doesn't matter what form of communication you are using.\\n\", '0,messenger sucks. it uses way more power than any other app, notifications persist until the device is restarted, constantly interrupts other screen activities and updates more frequently than any other app ive seen. i only live with it because fb forced us into it. soon im probably just going to ditch the fb app altogether and use fb through browser.\\n', '1,I have been waiting for this to pop up on my kindle. I have no problems with it and the chat heads even work on my main screen. Works perfect on my kindle fire HDX- love it!\\n', '1,Recently in Ireland it would be difficult to stay in touch. My niece put this on our phones and it was in deed a communication lifesaver. My friends from the states that had it could also keep in touch. GREAT!!!!\\n', \"0,Personally i love Facebook., So when I saw this app, I was happy. got it. That was about ten minutes ago...its still downloading. The sign that said it wasn't compatible with Kindle Fire didn't even pop up. I wish I never got this, because now my kindle is running very slowly just because it's still downloading and I can't stop it. Hope they Give us the no star option for reviewing, because that's what this app deserves. DON'T GET THIS APP IF YOU HAVE KINDLES!!!!\\n\", \"1,Most of you guys need to realize this isnt made by Facebook because it would not be called Facebook Messenger and instead Messenger. Facebook hasn't created any app for amazon as far as I know. Another thing most of these apps are made by someone who is nice enough to make an Amazon version so stop complaining and deal with what you have. Also it works just fine for me.\\n\", \"1,Don't see why everyone is complaining. It's a great app, runs smoothly. Let's you stay in touch with friends and family. To the contrary to what some people are saying, it's NOT a paid app. It's free. Honestly don't know why people are saying you need to buy it. Don't listen to them people.

It's inconvenient and drains my battery. Not to mention, your EXACT GPS location is sent to people you message.

So check your location sharing settings before messaging strangers.\\n\", \"1,Love this app. This is an app that I love having because I don't have to be logged into Facebook to get my messages.

Also the little bubble that stays on the screen can be annoying sometimes. Other than that it's an ok app, does what it's supposed to. But again, don't see why it's necessary when it could just be integrated into the FB app.\\n\", '1,I know I am not alone when it comes to my addiction to keep in touch with my friends and family where ever we are. This messenger is wonderful with chatheads, that show a photo the user is using on their Facebook. I love that it also tells them that I am using mobile instead of being on my PC so they understand I might be driving and unable to reply right away. I like using this instead of text messaging because it keeps us updated and we can all be on the same chat window and stay on it always. Sharing photos and information safely and its saved for later on our PC.\\n', \"0,This is a very annoying app. I just don't want to be that connected.

Shipped fast!!! Highly recommend .\\n', \"0,First of all, I can't believe I'm defending Facebook for anything. Second of all, the people who blame Facebook for Messenger not working on their Kindle Fire are mostly just ignorant. The Kindle Fire has 4% or less of the market, and uses FireOS, NOT the standard Android OS. THIS is why apps break on the Fire, guys. And how many developers do you think REALLY want to do something extra for people too cheap to buy a &#34;real device&#34;? (This is how it comes across to many developers) Third, Facebook Messenger is FREE. People who demand things this way for a free app are extremely selfish and entitled individuals. SOLUTION: Get some fresh air. Do something actually with friends and family, instead of relying upon a free app. Gain some healthy perspective. Stop acting as if Facebook is &#34;violating&#34; some right, because their app doesn't work on your crappy Amazon tablet. And if you want to yell at someone, then yell at AMAZON, because their tablet doesn't work with a lot of the apps which work just fine on everything else! (And, I'm betting you actually PAID for that Amazon tablet, correct???)\\n\", \"0,Literally stops working any time I sign out of my Facebook on my phone.

I only use the app for my Facebook messaging nothing else so I can't say anything about all the features that it has. I recommend this to anyone who uses Facebook and wants to be able to stay in touch with their friends and family on the go.

The only feature that makes it understandable to justify having the messenger app along with the original, on a smart phone, is that the notifications are more noticeable than the regular fb ones. All the other features and flashiness is redundant on a smartphone with a fb client already installed. No hate, but it's fb, so it's probably invading your privacy somehow at the trade-off for convenience and congruence.

But further research seemed to indicate it was really OK, and now that I have it, I love it. My phone makes a tiny Zing-ring noise when a message comes through, easy to check. Only irritation was the first time the Chat Head appeared and I couldn\\'t figure out how to get rid of it. Finally, a text box came up that explained the solution: press the chat-head and an X appears at the bottom of the screen, then drag the head to the X and \"Poof\" it\\'s gone. Note: I\\'m not a power-user of Facebook, still text way more than chat.\\n', '1,There are times when I rather just have Facebook messenger running instead of having the Facebook app going. I actually find that having the messenger app on my kindle fire works much better than the app on my phone. Since I take my kindle everywhere this allows me to keep in contact with those who I talk to regularly and also not cut into my data limits on my phone. Overall it works better than the other one that I have and I like it better.\\n', \"1,So yea, there's a lot of negative reviews , but I guess they fixed it. I'm writing this on November 22-2014, and this app works wonderfully well. It gives you the feature to have chat heads, so you can send messages while running something else on the device, at the same time, anyways it works great.\\n\", \"1,Works fine with both my Kindle Fire 7 & the family Fire 8.9 that my son uses most. Tested it out for my friend who has the 4 G version, and it looks and reacts like the PC version, as ours are tethered to wi-fi and are not as portable for social media. I mention my son as if you do not set controls on them via Kindle Freetime or the sync'd parental controls, they can use it on accident or purpose. He'd rather not have everything open for use, so it is a nice way to test it for my friends with kids who want to have everything open.\\n\", \"0,For an app I'm forced to have if I want to communicate privately on Facebook, it's not horrible. I wish it were a little more user friendly. I don't like how sometimes it kicks me out after I've typed a bunch. Or I have difficulty getting the keyboard to keep working. Sometimes I can see that someone messaged me, but I can't open it. works fine most of the time. when it gives me trouble I re-install it. When in doubt, reinstall.\\n\", '1,I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those \"filler\" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar \"guide\" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it\\'s mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you\\'re bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you\\'re into some of the cable channels, you\\'ll notice a decline in program quality. If you\\'re a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have \"those other 100 channels I really don\\'t watch\", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost\\n', '0,Whoever thought having an annoying chat bubble invading their screen is clearly some unsavory individual who likes to work up a sweat then walk into a swarm of mosquitoes. The same person must keep a pet fly that they trained to buzz in their ear as soon as they fall asleep. The same person who pays someone to drag their finger nails across a chalk board. The same person who styles Donald Trumps hair. The same person who designed the sound of a fax machine. The same person who let\\'s their dog poo in your yard. The same person who enjoys snow in April. The same person who enjoys infomercials. The same person who loudly plays ghetto rap in their 1993 pickup truck with low tires and, $800.00 rims, and blown speakers. Yes, that is the same person who made the decision that those chat bubbles were a good idea. They must have sat and thought, \"we can\\'t make this thing too good, so we probably should ad a feature so annoying that a person would rather get a case of pinworm while both hands are broken then have to deal with this feature\" Yes those chat heads did the trick.\\n', '1,Works good.

The message pops up before the sound, when they should be simultaneous. I wish they would upgrade every week like the android app does, this is an older version. All in all the app works fine. I like it\\n', \"1,I don't see what everyone is talking about when they say that this app don't compatible with the kindle fire because this app works perfectly fine for mine! Any way awesome app you should really get it.\\n\", '0,No updates on this phone. Pretty disappointing\\n', \"0,the app works properly with my Android phone. I would have given it five stars, but it drops a 'message notificaiton' button on my screen that is there all the time, and it gets in the way of using my phone.\\n\", \"0,There is new version but you didn't update your app store ??? you let us down and forgot us... if you don't care about your customers and don't want to add and upgrade applications on your app store let us install Google play ?????\\n\", \"0,I have an old version of the app because the app store won't let me update. The messenger app reminds me to update but when I press update it takes me to the app store and says no update available.\\n\", \"1,Every so often I download this app just to see if it will work. Today I successfully downloaded it to my kindle!!! Which is a huge deal since all my friends live in another state now and the actual fb app doesn't show my messages in the notification bar!!! So I'd you have been waiting to use it, try to get it in your kindle fire now!\\n\", \"0,It works on my fire for a day, updates, then just doesn't work. I've had to go back and reinstall it ever day so it works! Its starting to make me very mad. I have all my stuff updated to where it should, and still it happens. Please fix this stupid glich, its really annoying!\\n\", '0,No pop up/ push notice on Fire HDX or Fire phone, so unless you \"hear the beep\" you do not know you have a message. If you do happen to hear the FB pop clicking the notification does nothing, you have to actually open the app (even if it says chat head is open) to see who/what the message is.\\n', \"1,We use Facebook Messenger both to communicate with groups of friends on FB and for short texting when WiFi is available, but cellular service is unreliable. We like that the messages are stored until the recipient is in broadband coverage, so we don't miss messages like we do on Sprint texting.\\n\", '1,Got this for my kindle. Pros: -When turned on, it alerts you of friends sending you messages. -You can quit the program when not needed or to remove distractions on your screen. Cons: -Floating bubble icons can get in the way sometimes or hard to remove.\\n', \"0,If I could give this a minus 1 star I would. It half downloaded but won't open or even allow me to delete it. Really makes me angry because it used to work prior to the latest &#34;update.&#34; Sad because I used to use it often.\\n\", '1,I love this new way to get in touch with my daughter who lives in a place that has poor reception with her mobile phone. I think it is a great way to talk to our facebook friends and family when you cant seem to reach them the conventional way.\\n', \"1,I use this daily, I mean who doesn't right? I love it. My only complaint is not being able to access my other folder, very very annoying. With all the garage sale sites on Facebook nowadays its necessary to be able to see messages who aren't from friends a little more conveniently.\\n\", \"0,When I first installed the app, it worked great. It ran smoothly and I had very few issues. Then about 5 hours after downloading, my kindle was glitching it started to overheat. I hadn't made any other downloads after that, so I found that strange. I checked my virus app and it turned out that this app was the problem. I deleted it immediately and never redownloaded it. If whatever bug or virus was removed, I'd consider using it again. **note: this was on a kindle fire\\n\", \"1,It does what it's supposed to do. The only issue I have with it, and is pissing me off terribly, the call button is in the top right corner, and I constantly hit it accidentally, while swyping. Idk why it has to be on the screen at all? Smh. I've only been using it a few days, so I might find other issues later on, but at least it works.\\n\", \"0,The Amazon Fire phone version works but has way less features then I had using my Samsung Galaxy phone. You can't post to a specific group. There's no little face bubble when someone messages you. You can reply to IMs from Facebook only from a separate messenger.\\n\", \"1,I have this on my phone, and on my Kindle. It's easy to use, and much faster then, using the old way. It's nice to have when you're letting your phone charge, or you need a bigger screen! If you use Facebook a lot, I would get messenger, cause it's so much easier to use, then the old way, and let's you reply faster! The only problem I really had, was when I went to download it for the first time on my Kindle, it did take a few minutes to load, and to start working.

But I HATE that it doesn\\'t hardly ever let me know that there is a pending message request or \"filtered\" request. I do a lot of buying and selling on Facebook, so this is particularly annoying to me since I have odd people messaging me at all times of the day. And I still have no idea how to go and check your filtered messages from this. I wish facebook would stop with the stupid filtering anyways, but I would at least like a notification that its there. Annoying.\\n', \"0,I love the Facebook Messenger app...but for my Kindle Fire HD 7, I don't love it so much. I'm currently giving it a 3-star rating because the chat heads part crashes every single time I am using the app. It is not that the app crashes or freezes. It is that the chat heads disappear. And then I have to hunt down the actual app and retype what got lost when the chat head disappeared. I think if this problem gets fixed, my rating would improve, because otherwise, I am happy with the app. The disappearances are a huge problem for me, though.\\n\", \"0,What can I say, other then being so intrusive this app and Facebook just intrude Iin your life like a crazed ex girlfriend.if you read the permissions thou accept at the next update you will see what I'm talking about.went would you need to turn on my microphone or read my text messages or turn my camera on.I don't allow these two apps on any of our tablets or phones in my house.I don't even want to give one star.\\n\", \"1,I like not having to log into facebook just to view messages. I like that when I get a new message it pops up my kindle fire home screen and I can just click the picture and open the conversation with nothing else to distract me away from what I'm doing. I can respond and go back to my activities. I don't need to leave another app or game I'm in either. I love that I can just open the conversation and reply and than close it and automatically go back to where I was in my game.\\n\", \"1,ignore the year old reviews saying it doesn't work on kindle fire hd, because it does now (and has for a while). personally i love the Facebook messenger and I'm very pleased i can get it on my kindle fire. the messenger itself is fun and stylish. i swear there is a emoji sticker for your every mood. lol the stickers are a lot of fun. only problem i have had so far is that when the new message bubble pops up it sometimes leaves part of the bubble stuck on the screen and its very annoying and i have to restart my kindle to remove it. and in case you did not know, you can not use the calling functions from your kindle. (duh)\\n\", \"1,I am very dependent on this app. Because I lived in a foreign nation for two years, this app allows me to frequently communicate with those I love on a day to day basis. It is easily accessible and since it is free, it is a must have for your mobile device. I have a difficult time listing any negative comments about this app. Pros: this application does an astounding job of keeping track of past conversations you have had it with your friends on Facebook. You can quickly recall any previous conversations and continue communication with either individuals or groups. Facebook has allowed you to use certain Emoji's and gifs which add a fun twist to this application. The app loads quickly and after many months I have never had a single crash issue. I also use this app to communicate with my friends in other states. Cons: as I said before, it is difficult for me to list any negative comments about this app. One thing that may be be frustrating is the fact that those who you are chatting with will appear on your tablet or mobile device despite not having the application open. This is not a big deal, but can be annoying because sometimes their profile picture will be in the way of things you're trying to tap or click. Other than this I have no troubles with this app.\\n\", \"1,OMG, I wonder what I ever did without this! I moved to an island from CA and thought I might lose touch with important people in my life. Not so with Facebook Messenger app. I never miss a message now and do not have to go online to the full Facebook page to see if anyone contacted me. It's a real blessing because some friends are having health issues and some are in relationship crises and I can offer immediate support to them with this app.\\n\", \"1,It works perfectly fine. People are saying it only works on the Fire Phone but it's working AMAZING on the Kindle Fire. I can have a chat head open while I'm in another app, and if it gets in the way I can drag it down below and make it disappear. I can also instead of going to the app I can swipe down the menu screen and click 'Start A New Chat Head', and it automatically opens open in your app. Then, when you're done your other app is still 'under it' and ready for use. I love the Facebook Messenger application. It's great for people who don't get on FB and just want to chat. If you're looking for FB as well I recommend the regular FB app.\\n\", '0,I downloaded the app so I could talk to friends while my cell phone was on the charger. This works for that the only problem is that if I go to long using the app on my phone it severely slows down me Kindle when I eventually use it.\\n', \"1,Being face book decided to update , confused me during a chat session I thought I would give this messenger a try .

It's an easy app to use so I'm not sure why/how someone would have issues with it. It's never crashed, or had difficulty opening. If you have problems maybe it's not the app but the user.\\n\", \"0,Well finally Facebook realized that it forgot about Kindle users, so I got happy that the app showed up in the store. My happiness was not long. Have you even tested the app on Kindle? Do you realize that we cannot send files or other things? Plus when you click on the Facebook app to chat someone, it does not open the Messenger like it does on the phone. Fix the flaws first, test it, fix more flaws, test, etc... and only then publish your app and make people use it. It's very annoying otherwise.\\n\", '0,The app is more of a necessary evil than help.

Since it is compatible with my device then I would have to say that it works fine for me. Other people say that they want video chat. They now have it. You have to update your Facebook Messenger app to the newest version that they released June 14 2015. The app is amazing and you should definitely get it. But remember that you have to have a Facebook account in order to access this app. I would definitely recommend this texting app to others that have a Facebook account.\\n\", \"1,Fb message work very well on my kindle fire HD I've read some of the comments just about everybody is saying that it don't work on their kindle most of these messages are old so they must have up grade the fb message for kindle fire l have no problem with mines\\n\", '1,Messenger is absolutely great! I use it daily to stay in touch with my friends and family. I do believe anyone who is anyone is on facebook these days. That makes messenger pretty much a necessity. The emoticons, along with the easiness of use is what makes messenger so great! They have a wide array of downloadable content that you can send to any of your friends. You can also have group conversations as well.. This is always fun! I would recommend messenger to anyone who has a facebook account and a smartphone or tablet. Stay in touch with those you love!\\n', \"1,I love FB messenger. It's better than texting. Texting a long message can take more than one. The person gets the last part of the message first. Not good. With FB messenger, your message can be as long as you like.\\n\", \"0,It's bull, I was forced to download this to send and receive messages on facebook, and it keeps closing. It stays open long enough for me to see I have a message, but when I click on the messages to read them the app closes\\n\", \"1,The app all together is nice. It works like it's supposed to. I've noticed a lot of people said if they want to type an emoji or send a sticker, nothing pops up. I had this problem too. Just turn it sideways and it should work then. I'd give it 5 Stars if it let me send stickers up right instead of just sideways.\\n\", \"0,Okay, so I was reading the reading the reviews for this app, and everybody keeps saying it doesn't work with kindle fire hd, but I actually installed this app back when I first got my kindle. In December. It was compatible then. I uninstalled it due to problems. And when I installed it again, it's fine now. Okay, The notifications is pretty much the only issue I have. It doesn't show the chat icon for the side of the screen or give me any notifications what so ever, until 30 minutes later via email. So yeah.\\n\", \"0,Definitely NOT designed with the Kindle Fire in mind. It works but has serious problems with the way a Kindle OS functions. I'm forced to use it now the FB app took out messaging. So, at least I'm giving this app a horrible rating.\\n\", '1,I like everything about this app except that even though I can have more than one Facebook account, I can only use this app for ONE unless I uninstall, then reinstall to log in with other acct.\\n', '1,This is 1 of the best APPS ever discovered..u can talk to anyone in a matter of a minute or less..if their online or close to a phone..but the person u r contacting has to have Messenger too...\\n', \"1,I really enjoy FB Messenger!

You can text and call (video or not) via data. It's like What's App and Skype combined except that more people have this so you don't have to invite them to What's App or find out if they have a Skype account. Also, like iMessage, you can see that someone is responding to your text so you know to wait until they finish to text again. I was overseas with this app (free data) and could call my wife on her cell phone via this. Yes, you could do the same thing via Skype (pay to her cell number) but to do it for free she has to be logged into Skype.

No more leaving my web browsing to answer a message!\\n\", '0,THE ONLY THING I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT IT, IS THAT IT IS GOVERNMENT OWNED FACEBOOK PERIOD IS. THIS HAS SO MUCH LOW-JACK ON IT. JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, OR YOU ARE A HACKER, AND CAN REMOVE CERTAIN FILES. I PERSONALLY PREFER A ROOTED PHONE. YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH A ROOTED PHONE. BOTH FACEBOOK APP, AND FB MESSENGER APP, THEY CAN LISTEN TO PHONE CALLS, READ YOUR TEXTS, LOOK AT YOUR CAM, LISTEN TO YOU ANYTIME THEY WANT SAME WITH THE CAM. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT BOUGHT IT OUT. YOU CAN THINK THAT I AM A CONSPIRACY NUT, BUT GOD HAS BLESSED ME WITH COMPUTER SKILLS, MOST OF YOU WILL PROBABLY GO TO SNOPES.COM, BUT THAT IS ALSO GOVERNMENT OWNED. THIS WAS ON THE NEWS ALSO JUST SO YOU KNOW. LOOK IT UP ON YOUTUBE.\\n', \"1,I had resisted getting Messenger for a long time, thought I had no need for it. Now I don't know how I lived without it! So many things to love. separate from the fb app, you can still surf the net or troll fb and your little chat bubble will notify you when you have a message. Stickers are easy to get to, and last night I tried video chat with my daughter in college. We had a great time. Video was a bit choppy at times but audio never wavered. I put this on my kindle hd 6 and have not had any problems.\\n\", \"1,Messenger is fantastic. It links your Facebook friends separately from your Facebook page so you can txt free instead of using your txt minutes from your phone. If You have Wi-Fi it doesn't use your data either. Pretty nifty I think. Unlike my phone messaging not responding most of the time, messenger works most of the time.\\n\", '0,It has been working for me on my Kindle Fire HDX good, with one exception. Sometimes when I click on the chat heads, they dissapear, and I have to go back to messenger, taking the reason I got the app out. And yes, I did check the chat heads can poo up through other apps that take up the whole screen.\\n', '0,All my past chats and conversations disappear on their own. This happens to me on Android and BlackBerry devices as well. You need an update on Facebook Messenger for Kindle, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry A.S.A.P.!!!!!\\n', '0,I hate it. Facebook should\\'ve never done this to us. It\\'s ALWAYS ON. I don\\'t know how to deactivate it. Everytime somebody sends me a facebook message it goes directly to messenger and all my wireless devices ding. How can I be running messenger on 3 different devices plus my laptop at the same time?? I use this app only because it\\'s apparently the only way to get my facebook messages on a mobile device but I\\'m seriously considering removing it from all the devices and just making it not be an emergency because i\\'d really like to NOT have this thing bothering me all day and night. I at least know how to silence text messaging. EDIT to add: The thing that really bugs me about this is that it does not allow me access to my \"other\" inbox on facebook. I belong to a number of groups on facebook where I communicate with other members there but we are not facebook \"friends\". When we message one another about something better handled over private message than publicly in the group, it seems to be about a 50-50 chance whether it will go to my real inbox or my \"other\" inbox. Sometimes it takes days of me not seeing a message before the person says I need to check my \"other\" inbox and then I have to go log on to my pc if I want to read the message because this app doesn\\'t have any way for me to check the other inbox.\\n', '0,So, before fireos 4.0 I side loaded fbm from that other play store and it worked fine but it was slllooooooow. So much so that I uninstalled it. The app was never made available in the Amazon app store. But now that I have the fireos 4.0 upgrade, I went into the Appstore and it was sitting there waiting to be installed. I did and it runs a lot smoother. I am no huge fan of fbm. But I do use it, and having it available on all my devices finally is nice. I, personally, think all the security clearance concerns with it are overblown. Facebook itself is one big privacy ignoring entity. If you use Facebook, and fbm, then you have to use this app, like it or not.\\n', '1,love this i get to talk all i want to my friends..\\n', '1,Very nice\\n', '1,Very nice\\n', '1,excellent\\n', '1,Fantastic\\n', '1,Excellent\\n', '0,very nice\\n', '0,I hate it\\n', '1,Very good\\n', '1,Very good\\n', '0,It sucks\\n', '1,Very useful and clever to use.

Overall it's pretty lousy, but it's Facebook and their site sucks, but it keeps me in touch with people and it's free. To clarify, Facebook Messenger didn't used to run on Kindle Fire, but Amazon made Kindle Android compatible in a recently past update because of all the customer complaints about not being able to run so many apps that people use regularly.\\n\", '0,I have downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire specifically to try the \"call\" feature in messenger. So far, audio and video have had issues using this feature. Often experience delay in audio so it doesn\\'t match what you see. I have had the same issue and freezing on my smart phone when using the app. For texting it works great.\\n', \"0,Great app. I haven't run into many glitches. I do not like that if you aren't careful it will give your EXACT location on the app. I had to go into it and disable it, but it a very easy feature to accidentally turn back on if you aren't careful. Hasn't facebook ever heard of stalkers. I wish they would fix this to where it is harder to turn back on. I do not need anyone knowing my exact location!\\n\", \"1,I can share things with my friends from vine, makes it easier to show them a video in private. I'm able to do a lot with messenger.

This works yes but it is annoying and now with all the message requests it makes it worse. I don't like it but have to use it I suppose\\n\", \"0,I don't like it, there is little privacy. Anybody can text me directly on my phone and if I want to delete several conversations at one there's not an option for that, I have to go to every conversation and delete them as a single.\\n\", \"0,Why exactly is this required to message on facebook? It never used to. Now it makes constant noises every time I have the internet turned on, and tells people when I'm online no matter what the settings for it are at. REALLY annoying.\\n\", \"0,This is horrible! I have always loved messenger on my phone as well as Facebook. I work full-time online and since the updates it never opens or it crashes! I am losing sales because I can't receive the messages in real time. I have to find a computer at random times throughout my day just to check for messages. It is ridiculous! I'm beyond disappointed, I'm angry and this needs fixed! Facebook and messenger work together but won't work on my app? Yet they sure love billing me for advertisements...pointless to run ads if I can't receive the customers!!! You say give my opinion but you make me pick a star to submit it? No stars in my opinion! Only one star because the app store made me pick it. Fix it!!!\\n\", '0,This program is a pain in the butt since it is now it own entity apart from facebook. 1. There is no way to LOG OFF. You can only uninstall it. So if I want to lend my tablet to someone and not have them be able to access my messages, Id have to uninstall the whole thing. 2. You cannot access your \"others\" folder to read messages that may have been waylayed. 3. Wish I could just get my messages from the facebook app like before. However, those scardy cat out there- although it makes you give permission for the app to access your phone book, it WILL NOT make calls on your behalf or anything crazy like that. It is simply for the opportunity to sync your contacts and add your mobile phone number so people can call and text you through the app (and that is an optional feature that you do not have to take advantage of)\\n', '1,This app downloaded and installed properly.
